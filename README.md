# Valkyrien Pirates
This mod adds pirate ships to your world which sail of their own accord. These ships come with a fearsome crew, and cannons which will shoot at your ship. Killing the pirates will disarm the cannons, leaving the ship and its booty free for you to plunder!!

## Ships
Pirate ships generate as structures and are assembled by a Motion Invoking Block (unobtainable in survival) once within simulation distance. This block will drive the ship in a pattern - by default in a circle.

Pirates that spawn on ships have a special property: some pirates are designated as cannoneers or helmsmen. Killing a cannoneer will stop its cannon from auto-firing, and killing the helmsman will replace the ship's Motion Invoking Block with Spruce Planks.

## Cannons
To combat these pirate ships, you will likely want to bring your own cannons! Cannons can be created by placing a **Cannon Activator Block** behind a Dispenser. This will convert the dispenser into a **Cannon Dispenser**, letting you fire **Cannonballs** from it. To shoot a cannon, power the Cannon Activator Block (back of cannon) with a redstone signal.

## Crafting
The Cannon Activator Block can be crafted with the same recipe as a Dispenser, except with Gunpowder instead of Redstone Dust.

Cannonballs can be crafted with Blaze Powder, Gunpowder, and an Iron Ingot in any pattern.

## Shipwrecks
Shipwreck structures can be found throughout the world that contain treasure similar to what you can find on pirate ships.
